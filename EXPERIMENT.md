# EXPERIMENT.md
- Prompt sets: normal N=50; stress N=30; migration challenge N=20.
- Control axes: no D-bond vs D-bond; base models share seeds and decoding parameters.
- Evaluation: round-wise PSI/ECI; cross-model CMF; Î²_trigger curves; word/sentence/strategy-level error attribution.
- Ablations: remove semantic re-weighting / residual injection / feedback chain; observe PSI/ECI drops.
